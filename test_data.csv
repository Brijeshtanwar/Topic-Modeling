"Kotak Securities days are numbered, mark my work it wont last for much time.  Sooner or later who fall for zero brokerage would realise what mistake they have done by choosing Kotak Security as their broker. Any way here I am gonna list some issue I have  raised many times to Kotak customer representative, even though I have complete faith nothing gonna happen on these issues.1. Kotak Sec advertise themselves as zero brokerage trading platform, how one can trade if your platform (kotak neo) provide absolutely no intraday leverage or margin in scripts. Kotak neo provides leverage  on less than 100 scripts. So goodbye Intraday trading on Kotak neo.2. I have repeatedly asked a feature on the kotak neo mobile app which will provide an edge to the scalpers community by making lower tab (where HOME, WATCHLIST, ORDERS, PORTFOLIO, INVEST are situated)  static. Though this feature is available on the desktop site where the upper most tab remain static. Presently if anyone go to  execute an order the lower most tab disappear from the page as soon as order window open and after order execution one have to manually press   back button many time to go to home page and then navigate to position page. If the lower most tab became static like the web version it will remain on the window no matter which page is open. You can imagine where every millisecond is important how game changing it could be to the day trader and scalpers community.3. Spent some money on Tradingview   and have some better feature make available like trading directly from  chart, drag and drop execution features.I am again saying that I have complete faith there wont be  any change regarding these issue. And I believe that People specially newcomers will come to Kotak but will leave within no time because nobody wants to use a platform which is decade behind its competitor in terms of technology. Kotak cant survive by forcefully  Selling insurance in the name of recommendation",WEB/APP
Kotak securities is highly unprofessional organization. KS does one way communication. Liquidate shares of customer without consulting customer. Acting arrogantly on their own.
